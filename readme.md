Challenge for una-health
************************

To run the program head to the data_challenge directory, first set up a virtual environment. Then run the commands:
    - pip install django
    - pip install pandas

Once these packages have been installed, run the commands:
    - python manage.py makemigrations
    - python manage.py migrate
    - python manage.py runserver

The server should now be running and all you need to do is click the local host link displayed in the console.
